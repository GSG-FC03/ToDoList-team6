# User stories (purpose)

- As a user, I should be able to Add an infinite number of lists, list items, or notes.
- As a user, I should be able to Edit or delete  lists or notes.
- As a user, I should be able to remove any to-do from my list (remove it from local storage)
- As a user, I can still have my list even if I close the browser window

# Our Project Techniques:
- HTML 
- CSS
- JS 
- JS Dom

# User Journey:
Our App is a simple To-Do list app that consists of one page.
- At first, a user writes his/her To-Do point in the input feild 
- Then, the user clicks on the Add button that will show the To-do point in the result container 
- A user could edit through the Edit button: if a user clicks on the Edit button, it will show the value in the input feild and it will show a new button called 'Save'. after editing the value and clicking on the save button, the 'Save' buttton will disappear, and the value will get updated. 
- If the user wants to delete one of the To-Dos, all he has to do is to click on the trash icon. 
- If the user wants to delete all of his/her To-Dos, all he has to do is to click on the 'Delete All' button.
